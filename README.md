# Horiseon Code Refractor

Thank you for viewing Arielle's first challenge with the UCB Coding Bootcamp!

For this assignment, we were given a pre-built website lacking in sementic elements, alt tags for accessibility. Our goal was to make sure the HTML and CSS stylesheet flowed in a proper and logical manner and was correctly commented. I decided to try and tackle some of the more advanced topics we covered later in the week including mobile compatibility and scaling with flexboxes as well.

Please view the live site here:

Please note the following features of this build:

- Full mobile compatibility
- Accessible alt tags on applicable images
- Fully commented CSS stylesheet
- Anchor links in the navigation menu that point to specific locations on the page
- Favicon icon to appear next to the title on a new tab
- Flexbox header content

## The following screen sizes will yield these layouts:
